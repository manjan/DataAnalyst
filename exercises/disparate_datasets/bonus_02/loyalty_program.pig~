 * TODO: Find all customers who had at least five orders

 *       during that year. Split those customers into three
 *       new groups based on the total amount:
 *
 *        platinum: At least $10,000
 *        gold:     At least $5,000 but less than $10,000
 *        silver:   At least $2,500 but less than $5,000
 *
 *       Write the customer ID and total price into a new
 *       directory in HDFS. After you run the script, use
 *       'hadoop fs -getmerge' to create a local text file
 *       containing the data for each of these three groups.
 *       Finally, use the 'head' or 'tail' commands to check 
 *       a few records from your results, and then use the  
 *       'wc -l' command to count the number of customers in 
 *       each group.
